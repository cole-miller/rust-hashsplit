This repository contains hashsplit, a Rust library for computing various kinds
of rolling checksum. hashsplit aims to conform to the specifications collected
in Ian Denhardt's (GitHub user @zenhack's) hashsplit-spec repository:

	https://github.com/hashsplit/hashsplit-spec

Like those specifications, this library is a work in progress.

Development takes place on the `develop` branch, with `master` being
occasionally fast-forwarded to reflect progress. Commits that are not part of
the `master` history may be amended, retracted, etc., without warning. When the
crate gets its first release we'll adopt a more disciplined workflow.
