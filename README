This repository contains hashsplit, a Rust library aiming to implement the
specification at

	https://github.com/hashsplit/hashsplit-spec

Like the specification, the library is a work in progress.

Building hashsplit currently requires nightly Rust, since we make use of
`#![feature(min_const_generics)]`. Progress on stabilizing this feature is
tracked at

	https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74878

hashsplit is `no_std`-compatible, but many definitions require dynamic
allocation; these are marked `#[cfg(feature = "alloc")]`, with the `alloc`
feature enabled by default.
